<h3>simple calculator made using html css and javascript</h3><br>
I tried to make a simple calculator with the help of basics of html css and java script.
In the html code i have created a div under which my buttons are mentioned.
Under the css code i have tried to use box shadow, borders etc..to make my calculator look presentable.
In the java script code the code for working of calculator has been used.
